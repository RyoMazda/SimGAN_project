# Application of SimGAN (by Apple's paper) for Hand Writing Recognition

## What Original Paper does

[Apple's paper (SimGAN = Simulated + Unsupervised Learning GAN) Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07828)

* Simulater + Synthesized
  * They use Unity Eye to generate


## Ideal Goal





## What I did to test if the ideal goal works



### Results






# My Environment

* Python 3.5.1
* Tensorflow 1.0.1
